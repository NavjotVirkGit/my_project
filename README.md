# my_project
This repository contains some of my small projects.
1.	Autism Detection: The goal of this study is to diagnose autism based on a few characteristics similar to ASD, such as age, gender, ethnicity, jaundice, and so on.
2.	Breast Cancer Detection: If benign tumours are identified more correctly, patients may be able to avoid unnecessary medicines. As a result, this project includes BC pattern categorization and forecast modelling.
3.	Life Expectancy: This project aims to determine a country's life expectancy based on factors such as age, population, financial condition, and so on.
4.	 Python Assignment: Developed a model to identify the closest hospital with the requisite number of beds using geolocational data. Using the K-means technique, I created clusters of the closest data points around the centroid. To plot the nearest hospital, I used Folium maps and Tkinter to develop a GUI.
5.	Similarity_Api: Using Sequence matcher, Count vectorizer, TFID vectorizer, and BERT, I created a model to check for plagiarism. RestFul API was used to provide a user-friendly interface for the model. Customer information is stored in a database that is connected.
